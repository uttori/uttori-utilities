## NaiveBayes
A Naive-Bayes text classifier based on the idea of Bayes' Theorem,
which is used to calculate conditional probabilities.
The basic idea is to find out what the probability of a document belonging to a class is,
based on the words in the text, whereas the single words are treated as independent features.
Useful for categorizing any text content into any arbitrary set of categories.
Example: is an email spam, or not spam?
Example: is a news article about technology, politics, or sports?
Example: is a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions?

**Kind**: global class
